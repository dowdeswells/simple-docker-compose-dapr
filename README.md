# simple-docker-compose-dapr
simple solution to get docker compose debugging up and running is VS and Rider
can test the service with:
curl -v http://localhost:<someport>/weatherforecast 

current problems are:
 - <someport> is randomly assigned every time i open VS
 - chrome insists on https when running on a windows machine
